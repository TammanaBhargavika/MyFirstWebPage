## MyFirstWebPage
This is my first webpage based on my Details


After I started learning **Front End Web Development** I got very intreset to create my own page with my details.


I created this page whn i was in my 2nd B.tech  and on that we started learning Html along with CSS

I used very simple html and css tags in this page but it made my page look nice .

While doing this page i was in very basic stage of html. By doing this I learned more about html and css.
I get very deep intreset in web Designing.
